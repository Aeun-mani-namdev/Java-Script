// Primitive Data Types: These are immutable and represent single, simple values. There are seven primitive data types:

//1. String: Represents textual data (e.g., "hello").
//2. Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers (e.g., 42, 3.14).
//3.  BigInt: Represents arbitrarily large integers (e.g., 9007199254740992n).
//4.  Boolean: Represents a logical entity with two possible values: true or false.
//5.  Undefined: Indicates that a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
//6.  Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used for object property keys to avoid naming collisions.
//7.  Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.


// Object Data Type:- 

// Object: A complex data type used to store collections of data and more complex entities. This includes:

// Plain Objects: Key-value pairs (e.g., { name: "John", age: 30 }).
// Arrays: Ordered lists of values (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
// Functions: Callable objects that encapsulate code.
// Dates: Objects representing specific points in time.
// Built-in Objects: Such as Math, RegExp, JSON, Map, Set, etc.
